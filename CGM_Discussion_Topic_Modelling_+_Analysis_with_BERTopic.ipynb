they advertise how they take reading every minute seems incredibly disingenuous there way actually see that data also when looking the live reading and then going back look the graph afterwards

outside the cold libre trying get current blood sugar and always miss point taking another minute realize whoop that wa too much coming back the right number werent taught the cgm already ha minute delay that would relatively fine the software didnt user knowing there min delay would fine but having both the same time super annoying sick and have use alternative apps for reading because otherwise the sensor wouldve been useless for find really hard imagine how the abbotts people dont realize it just dumb and working like shit also cant imagine how can this device approved for making treatment decision can easily kill people maybe say you can use for treatment decision youre not trending dont know sometimes when look the screen will say one number and the graph will match then when look again minute later like that number never existed the graph will have changed and hadn seen with own eye that number would never known happened this what you mean predictive extrapolation been wondering why this wa yeah thats pretty much believe the official explanation make the history graph look better for analysis least thats what ive read somewhere libre doe this all the time you

way too inaccurate these two day are the last day libre freestyle libre and the difference between and imedc ha gotten too big the first few day when wa time check glucose level checked both with libre and imedc the average difference wa and rounded today woke with libre telling and imedc how that possible libre show glucose level ha been fluctuating between during the night but now dont believe wa really happy wake pretty nice blood sugar since wa month ago how fix this and what cause possible the libre got worn out and acting because it it last day the difference wasnt this big previously now dont know how calculate glucose level with libre alone which creates difficulty school every couple one get dud and have call abbott customer service but they are good about replacing them also you side sleeper compression low are thing the thing about cgms though that they are better for assessing trend and how your glucose level rise and fall through out the day and respond different food rather than individual snapshot like finger stick fwiw libre cgms are generally within spitting distance finger poke contour next one long it not rapidly changing that time havent eaten recently and past the peak action time fast acting insulin use finger poke verify that really low when get woken alarm compression low like you said are issue idea the libre that mentioned though didnt know they still made those\",\"why libre reading low doing something wrong first time trying cgm put the sensor yesterday the backside upper arm wa secure and for the first hour two seemed reading fine after while kept getting low glucose alarm the point where wa woken several time last night wasn laying the side that sensor one point wa reading sugar mgdl when finger prick showed level mgdl after hour improvement contacted abbot and they going send new sensor took the old one off and put new one making sure the backflabby part arm and not towards the side like old one and the second sensor doing the same thing far any insight the second sensor reading the exact same range the first average around with occasional dip into the and occasionally going into the only went after ate dinner while finger prick showed after dinner did get two faulty sensor row just weird that they both showing the same number should try different spot wait longer for the sensor stabilize almost want give after all the bad thing heard about libre personally soak sensor when switching and this give the most accurate result soaking when you place new sensor hour before the expiration your current one but not activate placing new sensor cause trauma however minor the site that will cause healing reaction placing new sensor hour ahead allows this trauma subside and result get more accurate reading the reading are prediction your glucose minute the future your arrow are finger stick will not close for like half hour can very close finger stick and ive had half dozen over year that were exactly the same finger stick soak mine well just like you noticed that activated sensor immediately after sticking have wildly inaccurate reading for the first few day and with those lovely low sugar alert however after soaking the sensor seeing much more accurate reading thanks for your response prediabetic maybe don know yet not sure that affect anything will have try soaking the sensor next time and seeing that help and yes aware that the reading lag behind minute mostly concerned because how big the discrepancy are monitor number and finger prick number cross finger that this sensor level out tomorrow literally got another low glucose warning typing this out lol\",\"libre had really bad low blood sugar last week woke with emts over top dropped while wa asleep first time year being diabetic got libre now avoid this problem had for hour and showing the app did finger check and wa this common for the first day for this inaccurate obviously correcting the but actually afraid will drop yes the first day usually pretty off and even after that the interstitial fluid that the cgm measure lag about minute behind your actual blood glucose\",\"low reading with new sensor been using the libre have been having issue with low blood sugar noticed that the first day place the sensor frequently alarm for low glucose matter what eat doe this happen anyone else just the new sensor getting acclimated you could try soaking new sensor placing your arm but not activating hour before removing the old one this and get much better reading when it activated this isnt approved thing abbott but doe work prolly ha with insertion trauma calming down second this ha tremendous effect the accuracy the reading\",\"libre for help understanding sleepinsomnia folk have sleep maintenance insomnia and getting the root very tricky get sleep fine but cant stay asleep considering libre think this issue may have something with blood glucose level doe anyone have experience this it pretty expensive just doing some research first seems like there free trial the for first timer but also say wont receive freestyle libre with this oromo thats confusing thanks for any advice anything that spike your insulin the evening going affect your sleep but this could managed simply not eating anything after and see that improves thing wa free suppose there harm testing out your theory dont know that pay full price before adjusting diet eating schedule first\",\"anyone else have freestyle libre fail all the time wa diagnosed with diabetes year ago for while wa using freestyle libre glucose monitor the kind you plug into your arm for week stretch liked way better than finger prick wasnt accurate but wa accurate enough that felt wa useful then several month ago they just started failing for ive tried using device since then and every single one them ha failed within day failed mean the reading show blood sugar off the chart low unless really overdo carbs then register blip tried complaining the company once but it pita process and replacement device wouldnt really help anyway given theyve consistently failed recent month did have one major change medication recently doctor added jardiance into the mix now different medication metformin glipizide and jardiance and wondering the jardiance somehow incompatible with the sensor any solid answer would appreciated the one time tried wa between and point too low compared finger stick test and not because the time delay either\",\"can these affected steam maybe this coincidence but yesterday took long hot shower moreso than normal and for the first time since starting use these sensor shortly after and since level have been mostly pretty low did couple manual test and those read between over the libre but dont have enough time using these know thats normal for what only about week and second sensor ever but this the first time level have been consistently low for long period time typically have spike the late morning and just couple brief low throughout the day during sleep wondering it possible that the sensor wa damaged the shower something seemed fine for week any other thought this type and not typically concerned much with low this seems weird and dont want keep doing thing bring level they are actually not bad range had one sensor that somehow started separating from the adhesive the adhesive wa firmly affixed arm this caused small opening which allowed moisture into the sensor where opening should didnt notice until got weird reading and the separation became really obvious youll probably need someone else inspect that seam it between your skin and the sensor where the separation occurs moisture shouldnt able get into the sensor\",\"those you with libre cgm you trust the number all went ahead purchased libre sensor out pocket doctor wouldnt prescribe for because she said isnt medically necessary decided wa best have some insight into number what food trigger big spike and progress with the diet and lifestyle change paid full price with that said feeling like cant trust the number for context weighed when diagnosed wa wa diagnosed jan take metformin twice day started really cutting out the carbs shortly after diagnosis then decided keto and for now because the ada diet guideline seemed completely crazy have had the first libre sensor applied for basically two full day set target range mgdl mgdl the two day have not seen any spike above understand there lag between the cgm and blood glucos test however whenever test blood between and for part the day when compensate for lag the cgm seems pretty close sometimes seems way off guess just worried that the progress look like making illusion really want believe that doing the right thing for body know this marathon not sprint but also figure you got train the right way run marathon any you with the libre others you trust the reading anything including finger prick have range accuracy worry le about the number and look more the graph like here egg for breakfast egg and piece toast think you are right looking the trend probably more productive under carbs per day most day nearly all those are from leafy green and nonstarchy veggie have some low net carb tortilla want try and then see they cause spike not thank you for your comment\",\"frustrating experience started using libre freestyle about month ago paid for the reader and per sensor and have used sensor three sensor outright failed the other sensor gave reading that were off more that point have had the sensor report when finger blood said have had the sensor wake night with low sugar alarm when finger blood wa consider experience with the freestyle waste and huge inconvenience quest control diabetes libre will refund any faulty sensor that fall off early give false reading replace not refund abbott know about the poor performance and it cheaper for them provide replacement than make quality product done with this baloney\",\"freestyle libre sensor placement and accuracy put first freeestyle libre sensor left arm little lower than would like for two week blood sugar wa never below few time wa even well over once wa but when checked with glucometers wa waited min and checked the sensor again and wa stll above today wa the week mark and changed sensor this time put about inch higher right arm it been for about hour ive checked blood glucose dozen time far and blood glucose ha been below the whole time havent double checked with glucometer yet double check the reading but least the rating now are more consistent with the old sensor blood glucose switch from about minute wa the with another problem and said blood glucose wa put sneaker and checked again just for shts and giggle and wa doe placement make difference you think got faulty sensor put mine thigh just squeeze the skin away from the muscle and stick seems pretty accurate the instruction say back the arm only\",\"strange libre graph have only used libre for about year but this time have never had graph like the one attached this sensor only few day old but those day ha been similar graph the sensor faulty possible for that much variability natural two contributing factor could experiencing pain that arm the moment not related the sensor insertion the attached graph from fast from about ampm can see food being factor expert

libre and the dexcom detect hypo currently have the sensor just had hypo mgdl and the sensor were giving over mgdl even though think the hypo had been there for least minute normally the dexcom more accurate than the libre for but strangely neither the detects hypoglycemia why that way tell you they might have been off your meter might have been off you are dehydrated that can sometimes make the

dont understand putting day activating actually anything prevent inaccurate reading can someone please explain usually put mine right one expires wait hour dont understand either far ive two defective sensor the first one ever used reading point called sent replacement immediately the second defective one happened yesterday day woken critical low alarm checked find point higher libre pissed thought maybe sleeping arm weird way kept getting critical low reading next hour finally enough called theyre sending new one return package old one didnt anyway say ive sensor fail first day day difference make put new sensor day take old one confused also make difference kind patch wear sensor trying different patch cant get sensor stay day without one some patch ive used open middle cover edge sensor tried new one cover entire area nonsticky middle right sensor ive seen people say sensor shouldnt completely covered hole center sensor prevent moisture buildup sweating but patch cover entire sensor far comfortable stay lot longer one open middle the idea that for the first hour the skin and surrounding tissue are reacting the trauma and injury imposed the needle that inserted the filament the reaction believed potentially cause inaccuracy during that time applying the sensor hour prior activating would then give the skin and tissue time react and then return some semblance normal and give you the chance bypass that hour possibly inaccurate reading and begin with reading that should more accurate thank you for explaining that make sense but leaf bit confused about the whole day thing put sensor hour before activate what happens the end the day wont reading day off ive had issue with sensor the final day giving reading that arent very accurate wouldnt this just cause the reading the last day inaccurate regarding the been using fully covering patch since started using main reason for using patch are protect the sensor and prevent from coming off knock arm against something like door frame additional water resistance have swimming pool and line spend more than minute don feel that open design patch would provide the protection need either these scenario based experience always recommend full cover patch\",\"likely sensor error again dammit using libre ive managed keep level green well within range month fact usually stay range time sensor expired morning replaced

have replaced that wa just wildly inaccurate using this method came here suggest this same thing fact wa opening the thread old wa saying maybe need put day beforehand guess say that lot around here

low reading alarm and saw glucose wa dinner wa balanced tilapia half cup rice and broccoli water drink two hour after eating glucose wa the day high and two hour after that wont freak out anything until have few day data case it just error eous reading not have finger prick test confirm number first you should check extreme high and low with finger stick meter libre can and often wrong it considered within perimeter it le from finger stick different people react differently food can not eat rice because make glucose spike pretty fast and stay spiked for several hour the other side can eat cup broccoli garlic oil and ring ding and stay under vegetable can often counter carbs nutritionist ha follow basic half plate veggie split the other half between protein and healthy carb like sweet potato bean not sweet sauce goal not spike more than point two hour after eating should heading down again hope this help\",\"cgm advise most recent wa which really good doctor appointment

low last hour saying arrow also compression low didnt wake boyfriend follow app freaked wasnt answering sick sensor giving many problem yes know get replacement suck knowing trust sensor wanted vent

like this all over the place while awake and trend are very inconsistent but then stable while asleep normally have low while sleeping switched the couple month ago and far have been le than impressed

find out after finger stick that it normal and now blowing low loses connection hardly ever take calibration always inaccurate reading ive contacted dexcom many time and yes they send new one but still doesnt correct the issue far the worst sensor ive ever had started the may wearing the side side the same time for like month for comparison before gladly switched over nutshell for like sensor since then literally did not have any problem except couple sensor experiencing occasional brief sensor issue all happening while glucose wa going extremely rapidly matter minute soon after which self adapted the extreme change all sensor gave just about the same accurate reading the expiring one replaced right not know why but have never experienced what they call compression low either can not

completely inaccurate have just started with and the reading are all wildly inaccurate woke multiple time during the night tell blood glucose level wa mmoll mgdl wish then maybe could have slept rather than getting woken every min tried calibrate this morning and jumped and glucose meter gave reading previously used libre and wa soooo much better dont feel like can trust this one all worth contacting dexcom wa only inaccurate while you slept then probably compression low specifically put left side right side sleeper and due neck issue never roll over cant get comfortable wasnt compressed wa giving low all night even though wa lying the opposite side after calibration still seems least mgdlish mmoll higher than the glucose meter reading not really sure buy into this whole

calibrate after had warmed but reading have been all over the place and just did another calibration ha showing the but fingerstick showing this common occurrence when placing new sensor some people say they calibrate during the first hour but your body still healing from the poke and the sensor can off for the first hour also dont calibrate when your number are changing going down your glucometer measure your blood glucose while the cgm measure interstitial fluid which about minute behind when ive calibrated it only the morning when fasting rarely calibrate and average blood sugar cgm almost perfectly match better just let the first hour and check the following day with fasting number verify\",\"new sensor seems constantly reading low started new sensor sunday since getting low alarm last one middle last night check finger stick well within normal number recalibrate carry would bad sensor should contact dexcom see get replacement level time give day usually that doe not call

pretty much over right now just kind coughing residual tiredness since having covid meter ha regularly been point off like the pic above also gave mysterious failed sensor reading about three day ago which had replace the old sensor continue actually right now also pretty new only had the dexcom for one month far and wondering the illness could interfering with the reading during these sudden supposed drop haven been position which the sensor could been pushed down truly loss this thing keep waking the middle the night when already having enough trouble sleeping with false low anyone have any insight here they could offer thank you very much advance yup saw comment recently similar post that said because covid now thought vascular virus basically mess with your blood some degree hence why people with severe covid have blood clot stroke heart issue etc can affect your dexcom reading even though dexcom doesn read blood blood play big role interstitial fluid which dexcom doe read advice would stock strip and supply for your meter until thing sort themselves out and stay super hydrated got good stock strip and now that the end which just cough also thank you for the detailed explanation this wa driving crazy for while though especially those late night alarm the night check strip and like what the fuck\",\"dangerously high while report urgent low last night blood sugar

soon start rising slowly becomes le accurate dexcom wa but meter said and the second dexcom came down picked again and wa cgms will naturally around minute behind your meter due how read the

after the initial set\",\"dexcom reading fluctuation first week with the dexcom and wondering normal that number can fluctuate that frequently within the minute update for example this morning woke value and within the next minute wa and rising found that really big jump did check against meter and showed honestly just surprised that the number can shift and down that quickly actually just logged here ask the same question this second day dexcom first time using the had switch after incident where inserted and kept bleeding like crazy anyways what noticed wa whenever take shower show reading that doesn make sense for example wa telling that with two arrow thought should correct but now telling and trending low like how that possible any insight would greatly appreciated please hot water cause false high you give minute after you shower and are out the cooler air should drop back normal know what you mean graph all over the place honestly feel like number were better before putting this lol\",\"new sensor data very choppy newly diagnosed here using dexcom starting only day ago just replaced sensor for the first time and new sensor show lot more updown jitter the first sensor varies mgdl between minute reading see pic for example waiting blood glucose meter arrive and can use that verify the accuracy the but what your best guess this behavior normal this sensor just not working well that normal for new sensor should even out after the first hour erratic behavior like that usually the result trauma the insertion point and possibly some slight bleeding this will interfere with the sensor ability read the fluid that us for measurement it still doing that like hour after youve installed new sensor you might want calibrate using your blood glucose reading once you get your meter dont anything like that until you actually have reading use input into the calibration routine it important that you the calibration immediately after the sensor ha updated and you have taken reading immediately after that the timing important\",\"tylenol messed with dexcom son had fever with cold today had given him ibuprofen everything wa fine till switched tylenol min after giving tylenol his cgm read when wa bgm his dexcom usually caliberated point only few point off this wa crazy sensor then failed minute later then read online how tylenol can falsey raise interstitial

according them doe mess with your reading not big tylenol user myself because have some liver issue it not medication that take myself pretty much ever it never really been problem for but definitely issue for the dexcom sensor doubt about that the only issue that ive had far with sensor with kiddo bleeding and then the sensor fail today but didnt call them about today sure they could ask that

crazy and other people had had similar issue with the tylenol thank you everybody for your comment appreciate\",\"dexcom wild variability havent changed where put them yet mainly arm but constantly doe this and loses connection also sometimes point off and then dead the next reading sometimes did this but are regularly doing this tried snap shitting picture phone but it black everytime wearing both right now had left when got far they are pretty close each other did have calibrate the when never have calibrate the been more than year with the wa off about point the first two hour compare that wa only point off and this wa point higher which would have made pump give insulin when did not need any far not impressed with when first put and for the first hour since wa always damn close

month now and had some question note wa previously using the for bit more than year first the wildly inaccurate for anyone else find number even after calibration are not all that accurate usually off

duringafter hot shower thankfully dont see the wild scatter plot reading that some user domy trend line are typically pretty smooth but the tends overdramatize rate increase and often daydream and show going back again when going down beyond that though it been pretty good ive had few failure with the but they have thankfully been relatively rare for one thing would recommend trying different

switched from with system the other please thank you never used the libre only the freedom libre libre use the dexcom now used use the dexcon until may have had great luck with dexcom sensor lasting the entire day the only one had trouble with are the two that used the required overpatches since quit using the overpatches ive not had any come off run outside every day from mile day occasionally run ultramarathons mile ride bike trainer inside least time week when that sweat profussely still issue thing differently than most though mount the sensor pectoral muscle prep that area differently too first you cant shower for least hour before applying the sensor hors after people tell you shower before applying just walk away they can not help you not all smh then prep the area shave using isopropyl alcohol shave cream shave all direction then apply isopropyl alcohol with exfoliating pad glove after that air dry open the box and then apply the sensor then press into for min second but usually after that take pair curved hemostat press the adhesive strip ainto skin look for lighter colored area that indicates le adhesion around the edge and stroke outn from the inside the outer edge

used both swear dexcom have only ever used dexcom thats all know when wa diagnosed asked several people who knew were what with and hand down the lifelong veteran all said tandem and dexcom were the

your advice skingrip shower daily and they stick veryyy well love them lot\",\"dexcom libre howdy have switch from the libre dexcom since the libre isn preferred sensor through insurance believe are starting with the and will the there are too many issue with the heard very hitormiss thing about the accuracy error sensor falling off worry bit wondering any you and user can give some insight and answer some question how accurate are the sensor know the mard better for the which would theoretically make the sensor more accurate compared the libre for anyone who ha used the libre you miss find having minute reading better than minute reading the size the libre very small and thin tend forget there and doesn bother lay pressure applied that arm the size the dexcom bothersome you get used and eventually forget there too compression low used get them frequently when first started using cgm but now hardly get them are compression low with the bad any tip signal lossbluetooth range this ha been hit miss with libre using iphone reader random signal loss will happen especially using safari this something that happens frequently overpatch making the sensor stick used use skin grip loved them death but they leaving scar and huge irritation area had stop using them know dexcom say that you have use their overpatch that included inbox but uncomfortable for what are some other option skintac wipe work enough would liquid skin tac better for these sensor tia doctor wasn able answer many question other than the fact that they like the dexcom better for patient the libre for the first and only sensor type and ive been for couple month largely love with these device find them much easier than fingerpoking all the time and they alleviated many worry and difficulty that would make stop even trying control type did say largely love ive probably had about sensor seem like they dont calibrate properly least quick enough for liking worst case ive seen take day for the difficult sensor fall line havent personally run into any compression low and that includes putting padded guard over them while playing ice hockey goalie what see false high while taking hot shower but these clear after two three reading have had the dexcom app crash once losing data would strongly recommend also getting the clarity app backup thank you for sharing your experience also love cgms they super awesome and replaces finger pricking for the most part given there isn any sensor error weird reading the calibration something that will very new since the libre ha option for that the sensor more than point off from your bgm they replace the sensor given that the dexcom ha calibration the sensor off more than point would into the app and calibrate and see the sensor level itself out glad hear compression low aren issue experienced the false high during shower like water hot and spicy lol also gotten some false low from shower but those hardly happen did think another question you have your phone connected bluetooth speaker the alarm sound still play just loud and can you customize the alarm the libre just ha screaming beep option lol when the app crashed did delete all your data did have the libre app that once and lost month data and had recalculate the gmi and everything have downloaded the dexcom clarity app and got that all set still have day libre won applying until this sensor over\",\"people experience dexcom one after year stable blood sugar ozempic hbac now rising previously used dexcom when used insulin and found more reliable than the freestyle libre looking into using one again and now have much wider choice doe anyone have experience using the dexcom one the and what your preference and why ive been unlucky enough use the dexcom one and the libre all using android phone the dexcom one the moment which current prescription could choose then would for the but only because the app offer the ataglance feature phone lock screen the dexcom one app doesnt have this have unlock phone and open the dexcom app see the dexcom once doesnt have app that run pixel watch either term application comfort and accuracy have not noticed any difference the smaller with lower profile than the one which the same size and shape the being able calibrate the dexcoms against finger prick seems make more accurate than the libre that need calibrating and after it been calibrated dexcoms are complete pain you get sensor that need calibrating have never personally had issue with the adhesive it always stayed and never caused irritation regardless which device use thanks used them when they first came out the calibration issue including for sensor are burnt into psyche pixel and using fitbit doubt will work the fitbit may try the dexcom one and get round buying pixel watch consider the then ill self funding and hope this will avoid having back insulin but have feeling that may forlorn hope\",\"verbal alarm dexcom ive been for year and just over year ago wa moved freestyle libre this wa huge improvement life needle phobic never actually injected myself without automated sprung loaded device not having finger prick wa added bonus wa moved onto

control aware that dexcom have numerous alarm but non are verbal doe anyone have any idea how could get verbal alarm with this proposed system thought xdrip support dexcom well libre have you looked into using for verbal dexcom alert understand quite few dexcom us use xdrip the number phone supporting the dexcom app limited used the dexcom app when trialling dexcom and found it functionality limited especially when reviewing history you have use different appwebsite migrated from libre dexcom permanently would continue with xdrip have you tried using libre with xdrip find xdrip more

just using iphone okay thank you wa hoping not have bring blood meter with these event but wasnt sure how reliable would worst case leave early\",\"very unhappy with dexcom started using the dexcom earlier this year paired with omnipod and wa great made number much easier manage and would barely have any low with but since they are slowly discontinuing the upgraded the sensor little over two week using havent had sensor last more than day the dexcom graph wa always smooth and accurate for but with the constantly bouncing around drastically rarely had have any sensor error but with the they are frequent sometimes multiple them day like the smaller size and shorter warm time but those are the only pro for the wa great for and now ive had alot more low and more high since switching the and it honestly really stressful wondering anyone else ha similar experience opinion the because for it big downgrade from the deleted deleted well thats good hear started the late it life cycle thats probably why didnt run into many issue with know the relatively new product but it still frustrating because working properly directly correlated health lol hopefully ill have better luck with the sensor soon and ill eagerly for when the becomes compatible with the omnipod\",\"dexcom should taken off fda approval device list the ha very poor sensor that need completely redesigned every day

coverage change are forcing switch from libre android user with fitbit sense running glance use the skin grip cover well looking for any tipstricks from anyone that ha made the change well switched from the libre the overall happy miss day schedule knowing saturday whatever day instead day like the ability start sensor before the ending the previous gap coverage ive had very good luck with them sticking had issue with the libre had buy patch over them but far the ha been good with just the included patch also using android like the software much better for the dexcom product really hated the required full volume notification the libre especially when knew wasnt low blaring into headphone while treadmill when had the volume low wa jarring say the least have samsung watch and using gwatch wear app get reading also use xdrip and see number the always display while the dexcom isnt perfect and miss the day life well the minute update like most everything else about good luck\",\"dexcom

dexcom libre used the libre the beginning the year and had one sensor fall off few day one that lost connection and crapped out and one that kept giving low night all night long got the libre prescribed couple week ago and had the from till the morning and did not know how fix just ripped off upset because paid for sensor that don plan using after the libre and literally traumatized their alarm sound told endo want try dexcom bought new apple watch last week cause heard the app compatible see your mbers picked dexcoms and insurance covered cost wa mind blown have such life changing device for love that you can calibrate your reading adjust alarm setting and can see number apple watch all day reading have been fairly range finger prick and they not just calibrate and all good happy with dexcom experience with the libres they report low with well point lower than finger stick even during the day when fast acting insulin time will bring down into the the libre will report then have poke finger anyways least with the dex one can make adjustment when needed\",\"dexcoms stelo their new noninsulin day and probably cheaper sensor this wa mentioned month ago being development specifically for noninsulin type glad see it going reality look out summer edit take this from the article and what read elsewhere previously that the app will remove the alarm for high and low maybe the lessened liability make for le costly production somehow dont really see the sampling rate getting stretched any farther than the existing minute because that get into the unusable territory with reading too far apart based what ceo claimed interview last year will last day\",\"hate dexcom thanks insurance switched from the libre the dexcom february and hate first all the overpatch why white black even clear would much better when inserted the sensor bled little the overpatch wa blood stained the whole rest the time really great look what world wearing something white your body for straight day good idea the alert the app theyre quiet and short and linked the medium sound this actually piss off the most and make really upset haha with the libre the alert overrode all volume setting and kept beeping until you actually acknowledged least think the point that wa loud enough and long enough that you had plenty time hear and react downloaded xdrip and use companion app solve that problem but xdrip frequently miss reading several time hour it only updating every min worried that going have overnight low and sleep right through second sensor reading were wildly different than the finger stick even after several day and calibration they had send different one accidentally hit the corner the wall with arm and the sensor tore right off the adhesive and everything all the patch were left arm nothing even remotely close this ever happened with the libre most recent sensor upon warmup said sugar wa meter said never had problem with the libre taking fing hour accurate fact wa accurate immediately anyway thanks for listening just needed vent hahaha also had adapt the switch had mindful not inserting new one during spike and learning calibrate reading with finger stick during the first hr some will spot others will take bit but then remain accurate allergic the over patch found colorful hypoallergenic one amazon they also have black these helped keep mine and looking fresh think there are couple different phone apps link your dexcom but currently only using the receiver there might better alarm setting one the others not familiar with xdrip wonder you can get like audio kind like those dancing light kid toy maybe you can sleep with something like that nearby know there also new large display clock with alarm that you have hit like

before the day they will replace charge all cgms including the dexcom can give bad reading and you check the dexcom board people are hating the le good than the\",\"people experience dexcom one after year stable blood sugar ozempic hbac now rising previously used dexcom when used insulin and found more reliable than the freestyle libre looking into using one again and now have much wider choice doe anyone have experience using the dexcom one the and what your preference and why ive been unlucky enough use the dexcom one and the libre all using android phone the dexcom one the moment which current prescription could choose then would for the but only because the app offer the ataglance feature phone lock screen the dexcom one app doesnt have this have unlock phone and open the dexcom app see the dexcom once doesnt have app that run pixel watch either term application comfort and accuracy have not noticed any difference the smaller with lower profile than the one which the same size and shape the being able calibrate the dexcoms against finger prick seems make more accurate than the libre that need calibrating and after it been calibrated dexcoms are complete pain you get sensor that need calibrating have never personally had issue with the adhesive it always stayed and never caused irritation regardless which device use thanks used them when they first came out the calibration issue including for sensor are burnt into psyche pixel and using fitbit doubt will work the fitbit may try the dexcom one and get round buying pixel watch consider the then ill self funding and hope this will avoid having back insulin but have feeling that may forlorn hope\",\"dexcom just suck ive been longtime user the and typically lasted for day recently upgraded the and it been the opposite experience with huge random gap number sometimes reporting super high low without fingersticks matching and dying after day wearing upper arm they report and did for the doe anyone have the same experience there some tip something folk have found make work well how you get last day doesn time out after ten day you can remove the transmitter while leaving the sensor youtube tutorial use fingernail guitar pick something let sit for bit and then stop the sensor let sit for bit and reinsert the transmitter into the sensor start with sensor code youve seen before and then will start normally and give you another ten day ive never gotten one last more than day but generally pretty achievable\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"8_dexcom_libre_used\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"8_dexcom_libre_used\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[8.707357406616211,8.888772010803223,8.721229553222656,8.654661178588867,9.059847831726074,8.85075855255127,9.023058891296387,7.305209636688232,8.778623580932617,8.332683563232422,8.69119644165039,8.365026473999023,6.33094596862793,8.266561508178711,8.906410217285156,8.734699249267578,8.712166786193848,8.778118133544922,8.721372604370117,8.772442817687988,8.966351509094238,8.848458290100098,8.811666488647461,9.05891227722168,7.061683654785156,7.908825874328613,8.441187858581543,8.180461883544922,8.311976432800293,9.014657020568848,8.921692848205566,8.678017616271973,8.844359397888184,7.663435459136963,8.757134437561035,7.273290157318115,8.948644638061523,8.148713111877441,8.485278129577637],\"y\":[6.255378246307373,5.721477508544922,5.492053985595703,5.471895694732666,5.384541034698486,5.7532196044921875,5.8826494216918945,5.288456439971924,5.725922584533691,5.162192344665527,5.597531795501709,5.189494609832764,3.672459602355957,5.907263278961182,5.75013542175293,5.693272113800049,5.377411365509033,5.732743263244629,5.388036727905273,5.478789806365967,5.868342876434326,5.456141471862793,6.165198802947998,5.326948165893555,5.245717525482178,5.649564266204834,5.327620983123779,5.478672027587891,5.151183128356934,5.4918718338012695,5.536645889282227,6.339244365692139,5.600779056549072,5.4074931144714355,5.39394474029541,5.239288806915283,5.824319839477539,5.46114444732666,5.523396015167236],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"extreme

for year recently have switched the omnipod system using the dexcom sensor and wanted jump here compare them the dexcom system fantastic better every way than the medtronic system the medtronic system

properly stuck there for week the medtronic accuracy wa awful consistently mmoll mgdl off and would get worse through the life the sensor dexcom consistently bang accurate after over week the

medtronic pump sensor falling off would often leave for long period where had sensor and fell back fingersticks the poor accuracy meant wa hesitant trust the reading from the cgm make adjustment worse
